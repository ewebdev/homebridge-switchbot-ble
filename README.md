## Configuration

Add this to your homebridge `config.json` file

```json
"platforms": [
    {
        "platform": "SwitchBotPlatform",
        "name": "SwitchBotPlatform"
    }
]
```

If it work, add devices.

```json
"platforms": [
    {
        "platform": "SwitchBotPlatform",
        "name": "SwitchBotPlatform",
        "devices": [
            {
                "type": "bot",
                "name": "Bot 2c",
                "bleMac": "d4:cc:43:97:ae:2c"
            },
            {
                "type": "bot",
                "name": "Bot 51",
                "bleMac": "e7:4d:36:cf:9e:51",
                "scanDuration": 2000,
                "pressMode": true
            },
            {
                "type": "curtain",
                "name": "Curtain 11",
                "bleMac": "ec:58:c5:d0:01:11",
                "scanDuration": 2000,
                "reverseDir": false,
                "moveTime": 2000
            },
            {
                "type": "meter",
                "name": "Meter 84",
                "bleMac": "d0:d5:64:14:43:84",
                "scanDuration": 5000,
                "scanInterval": 60000
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

**Required Settings**

- `devices` - SwitchBot devices list.
- `type` - Device type. Currently supports `bot`, `curtain` and `meter`.
- `name` - Device name.
- `bleMac` - Device MAC address. You can find it in App settings.

**Optional Settings**

- `scanDuration` - Scan timeout. BLE Central must first scan the advertising. Default is `1000` (unit: ms). Longer time to ensure device discovery but slower response.
- `reverseDir` - Set to `true` to exchange the "opened" and "closed" directions of Curtain after calibration. Default is `false`. So you can swap the directions without recalibration.
- `moveTime` - Set the actual running time of Curtain, which is also the time to switch from running state to opened/closed state in the Home APP. Default is `2000` (unit: ms).
- `scanInterval`
  - For a Meter, sets how frequently to scan in order to retrieve temperature and humidity values. Default is `60000` (unit: ms).
  - For a Curtain, sets how frequently to scan in order to retrieve the curtain position. Default is `60000` (unit: ms) when idle.
- `openCloseThreshold` - Set the threshold before/after which the curtain is reported as fully open/closed to HomeKit. Default is `5`, so any position under 5% is reported as fully open and above 95% as fully closed.  
- `pressMode` - Set to `true` to treat "Press mode" of Bot.

Please note that:

1. The device `name` cannot be the same.
2. Restart HomeBridge after updating the config file.
3. The "opened" and "closed" directions of HomeKit are the same as those in Curtain and SwitchBot APP, but the percentage definitions are different. "Closed" is 0% in HomeKit but 100% in Curtain and APP.
